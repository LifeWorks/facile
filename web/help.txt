This is a web interface to run facile remotely.  Please learn the basics of
facile before using this web interface.

Facile requires an input file specifying the system to be simulated and/or
analyzed.  It also requires a series of options that tell facile the type
of output to generate.

This web interface allows the user to (1) upload the input file (2) specify
facile options and (3) download the file/files generated by facile.
 
The welcome page contains a form to (1) upload the input file and (2)
specify facile options.  The upload input form is standard, simply browse
and select an input file from your local computer.  Concerning (2), the
options should be a series of characters, each character specifying an
option (see facile manual).  The options should be written the same way you
would write options for the command-based facile.  For example, -rm or -r
-m would tell facile to output a reduced form of the system for matlab.  In
addition, the welcome page contains this text and a series of example input
files.  Feel free to download, edit and use them as inputs for facile.

Pressing "upload file and run facile" runs facile with the options and the
file as specified in the welcome form.  This takes us to step (3) above.
The text that facile outputs to screen is redirected to the page and it
will be shown below the line "facile says:".  In addition, you will find a
list of files.  These are the files output by facile.  You can click on
them to view them or right-click to download.  Make sure you do either
because the files will not be accessible after a few minutes.
